                    <p>The Republic of San Magnolia has been at war with the Giadian Empire for nine years. Though it initially suffered devastating losses to the Empire's autonomous mechanized Legion, The Republic has since developed its own 
                    autonomous units, called Juggernauts, which are directed remotely by a Handler. While on the surface the public believes the war is being fought between machines, in reality, the Juggernauts are being piloted by humans 
                    and all of them are the Eighty-Six, the designation given to the racial minority Colorata of The Republic who originally had equal rights as the dominant Alba race but were persecuted and scapegoated by the racist-led 
                    Alba government to the point the Colorata were considered not human, not allowed to have names and forced to live in internment camps in the Eighty-Sixth Sector while being forced to fight in the Republic's war with the 
                    Empire to restore their family's civic rights.<br>
                    Vladilena "Lena" Milizé is an Alba noble of Major rank in the Republic's Military who is assigned as a Handler of the elite Spearhead Squadron comprised of seasoned Processors 
                    who have earned names. Led by their field commander and squad leader, Shinei "Undertaker" Nouzen, the Spearhead Squadron are infamous due to many Handlers who have commanded the squad having their psyche broken down and some 
                    even committed suicide. As Lena gets to know Shinei and the rest of the Spearhead squadron, she becomes sympathetic to his people's plight and tries to help them. At same time, Lena and Shinei learn a dark secret: the Republic
                    and the war with the Empire is not what it seems on the surface.</p>
