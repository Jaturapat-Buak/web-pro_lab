                    <h1>Appearance</h1>
                    <p>Kaie was a short, slender Orienta girl with black hair and eyes. She kept her hair in a long ponytail. Commonly found in the Spearhead squadron uniform alongside others.</p>

                    <h1>Personality</h1>
                    <p>As the oldest in the Spearhead Squadron, Kaie was the most mature in her worldview. She understood not to generalize the Alba and the Eighty-Six as monolithic groups from her experience in the internment camps, as well as from hearing the recounts of her squadmates' experiences such as Theo's former captain and Anju's discrimination.
                        She was the type of person to quip and tease the other members of Spearhead. She called Shin out on his lie when he said he was illiterate, and was very aggressive in teasing Kurena regarding her crush on Shin.
                        She was one of the more vocal communicators with Lena, being honest with the handler, if sometimes blunt.</p>
